* Model variables for 3D position --> x, y, z? 
* Decide boundary crossing considering direction of the particle
* Face neighborhood: use distance from straight line (direction of particle) to trajectory to bound maximum depth search.
 * Add dQ to improve this bound 
 
 * Better parallel tests
 * Segfault when partition has different name than model binary
